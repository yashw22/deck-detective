## **Rules of the Game**

### **Objective**
The objective of Sleuth is to determine the exact identity of the hidden card before your opponents by collecting clues, asking questions, and analyzing the responses.

---

### **Setup**
1. **Players:** 3 to 5 players.
2. **Deck Setup:**
   - Shuffle the deck of cards (54 cards: diamonds, clubs, hearts, spades).
   - Remove one card from the deck and place it face down as the **hidden card**. This card is the mystery card all players need to deduce.
   - Distribute the remaining cards evenly among the players.
3. **Clue Cards:** Distribute clue cards (optional, if you use clue mechanics) or allow players to rely on memory and deduction.

### **Gameplay**
The game is played in turns, with players taking turns to ask questions and gather information. Follow these steps:

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - Decide the first player randomly.
   - Play proceeds clockwise.

2. **On Your Turn:**
   - You may ask another player about one of their cards. For example:
     - "Do you have any diamonds?"
     - "Do you have a card with the number 7?"
   - The player must respond truthfully but does **not** reveal their card publicly. They simply answer:
     - "Yes, I do," or
     - "No, I don‚Äôt."

3. **Note Taking:**
   - Players are encouraged to keep notes privately to track questions and responses.
   - Use this information to narrow down the possibilities for the **hidden card**.

4. **Passing Turns:**
   - After asking one question, your turn ends, and the next player takes their turn.

---

### **Special Rules**
- **No Repeated Questions:** You cannot ask the same question twice in consecutive turns to the same player.
- **Bluffing is Not Allowed:** Players must always answer questions truthfully.

---

### **Winning the Game**
1. **Guess the Hidden Card:**
   - When you are confident about the identity of the hidden card, you may declare your guess on your turn instead of asking a question.
   - If your guess is correct, you win the game!
   - If your guess is incorrect, you are eliminated, and the remaining players continue.

2. **End of the Game:**
   - The game ends when someone correctly guesses the hidden card or when all but one player is eliminated.

---

### **Tips for Players**
- Ask strategic questions to eliminate possibilities and gain key insights.
- Track responses carefully and cross-reference them with your hand.
- Be mindful of what information you‚Äôre giving away with your questions!
